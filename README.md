# Tic Tac Toe

1. First we get users' names with the prompt functions.

```
const userCall = () => {    // creating a function for asking the name of the players 
 user1 = prompt('What is your name Player 1? ');          // create variable for player 1 from user prompt
console.log(`Your name is ${user1}`);


  user2 = prompt('What is your name Player 2? ');  // create variable for player 2 prompt 
console.log(`Your name is ${user2}`);

}
```

2. Then we get users to pick 'X' or 'O'.

```
const userSymCall = () => {                     // this is the function to let users pick their symbols 

    userSym1 = prompt(`What is your Symbol ${user1}? X or O? `);
    
    if (userSym1 === "X" || userSym1 === "x" ) {  // checks to see if user inputed lower or uppercase X
        userSym1 = "X"
        userSym2 = "O"
        console.log(`${user1} is ${userSym1} and ${user2} is ${userSym2}` )
    } else if ( userSym1 === "O" ||  userSym1 === "o" ) {  // checks to see if user inputed lower or uppercase O
        userSym1 = "O"
        userSym2 = "X"
        console.log(`${user1} is ${userSym1} and ${user2} is ${userSym2}`  )
    } else {
        console.log(" You did not put in a valid response");
    }
}
```

3. We set up the symbol picking feature to go off of what the first user picks. 

We set up a game board with 3 arrays for 3 rows of squares to play tic tac.
 
 Each spot on the board is represented by a number.

 We started a pick square function for player 1 to make his selection on the board. we used 3 conditional statements to determine where the selection will be placed.

 We set up the player turn loop to have the game run, each player is asked to pick a spot on the board and place their symbol on the board.

* a dd a randomizer to figure out who who goes first *

3. We added a randomizer to randomly decide whether 'X' or 'O' goes first.

```
const randomizer = () => { // this is the function to determine who goes first
    turn = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) ;
   
    }

```

4. We added a function to check if there was a winner and which player it was after each key entry. 

```
const checkWinner = () => { 

    if (
        (topRow[0]=== "X" && topRow[1]=== "X" && topRow[2]=== "X")  // check for 3 in a row for first row
        ||
        (midRow[0]=== "X" && midRow[1]=== "X" && midRow[2]=== "X")  //  check for 3 in a row for 2nd row
        ||
        (bottomRow[0]=== "X" && bottomRow[1]=== "X" && bottomRow[2]=== "X")  // check for 3 in a row for 3rd row
        || 
        (topRow[0]=== "X" && midRow[0]=== "X" && bottomRow[0]=== "X")//check left column
        ||
        (topRow[1]=== "X" && midRow[1]=== "X" && bottomRow[1]=== "X")//check middle column
        ||
        (topRow[2]=== "X" && midRow[2]=== "X" && bottomRow[2]=== "X")//check right column
        ||
        (bottomRow[0]=== "X" && midRow[1]=== "X" && topRow[2]=== "X")// check diag left to right from the bottom
        ||
        (topRow[0]=== "X" && midRow[1]=== "X" && bottomRow[2]=== "X")//check diag left to right from the top
        ) { 
            console.log("X is the winner. "); 
    } else if (
        (topRow[0]=== "O" && topRow[1]=== "O" && topRow[2]=== "O")  // check for 3 in a row for first row
        ||
        (midRow[0]=== "O" && midRow[1]=== "O" && midRow[2]=== "O")  //  check for 3 in a row for 2nd row
        ||
        (bottomRow[0]=== "O" && bottomRow[1]=== "O" && bottomRow[2]=== "O")  // check for 3 in a row for 3rd row
        || 
        (topRow[0]=== "O" && midRow[0]=== "O" && bottomRow[0]=== "O")//check left column
        ||
        (topRow[1]=== "O" && midRow[1]=== "O" && bottomRow[1]=== "O")//check middle column
        ||
        (topRow[2]=== "O" && midRow[2]=== "O" && bottomRow[2]=== "O")//check right column
        ||
        (bottomRow[0]=== "O" && midRow[1]=== "O" && topRow[2]=== "O")// check diag left to right from the bottom
        ||
        (topRow[0]=== "O" && midRow[1]=== "O" && bottomRow[2]=== "O")//check diag left to right from the top
        ) {
            console.log("O is the winner. ");
    }

}

```

We then started troubleshooting the game app. We figured out that it would become good practice to fix the UI in terms of having the player whose turn it is be shown his name and symbol during theirting turn.

We also added code to validate each of the users prompts. Just in case if they add a weird answer it would just re start the prompt until the prompt gives a valid answer.

At the end we seperated the global values, functions and the function calls in their own containers.
